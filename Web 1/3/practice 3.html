        <h2 id="text1">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br />
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br />
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br />
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br />
            remaining essentially unchanged. <br />
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br />
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
            Ipsum.<br />
        </p>
        <h2 id="text2">Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page <br />
            when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
            <br />
            of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
            desktop<br />
            publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
            for<br />
            'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
            years,<br />
            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
        </p>
        <h2 id="text3">Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br />
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br />
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor<br />
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure<br />
            Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through <br />
            the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<br />
            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" <br />
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on <br />
            the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,<br />
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br />
            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.<br />
            Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced <br />
            in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.<br />


        </p>
        <h2 id="text4">Where can I get some?</h2>
        <p>
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,<br />
            but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,<br />
            or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going<br />
            to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing<br />
            hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to<br />
            repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the<br />
            Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of<br />
            model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated<br />
            Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
            etc.<br />

        <h2 id="text5">Digital Ipsum</h2>
        <p>
            The decade that brought us Star Trek and Doctor Who also resurrected Cicero—or at least what<br />
            used to be Cicero—in an attempt to make the days before computerized design a little less painstaking.<br />
            The French lettering company Letraset manufactured a set of dry-transfer sheets which included<br />
            the lorem ipsum filler text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and layouts. These sheets of lettering<br />
            could be rubbed on anywhere and were quickly adopted by graphic artists, printers, architects,<br />
            and advertisers for their professional look and ease of use.<br />

            Aldus Corporation, which later merged with Adobe Systems, ushered lorem ipsum into the information <br />
            age with its desktop publishing software Aldus PageMaker. The program came bundled with lorem ipsum<br />
            dummy text for laying out page content, and other word processors like Microsoft Word followed suit. <br />
            More recently the growth of web design has helped proliferate lorem ipsum across the internet as a
            placeholder<br />
            for future text—and in some cases the final content (this is why we proofread, kids).

        </p>
        <h2 id="text6">Form Over Function</h2>
        <p>
            So when is it okay to use lorem ipsum? First, lorem ipsum works well for staging.<br />
            It's like the props in a furniture store—filler text makes it look like someone is home.<br />
            The same Wordpress template might eventually be home to a fitness blog, a photography website,<br />
            or the online journal of a cupcake fanatic. Lorem ipsum helps them imagine what the lived-in<br />
            website might look like.<br />
            Second, use lorem ipsum if you think the placeholder text will be too distracting. For specific
            projects,<br />
            collaboration between copywriters and designers may be best, however, like Karen McGrane said,<br />
            draft copy has a way of turning any meeting about layout decisions into a discussion about word
            choice.<br />
            So don't be afraid to use lorem ipsum to keep everyone focused.<br />
            One word of caution: make sure your client knows that lorem ipsum is filler text. You don't <br />
            want them wondering why you filled their website with a foreign language, and you certainly<br />
            don't want anyone prematurely publishing it.<br />
        </p>

        <h2 id="text7">Hedonist Roots</h2>
        <p>Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text.<br />
            “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,”<br />
            Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate<br />
            the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”<br />
            As Cicero would put it, “Um, not so fast.”<br />
            The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,<br />
            consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.<br />
            Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with<br />
            discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum,<br />
            his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin<br />
            dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of<br />
            Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.<br />
