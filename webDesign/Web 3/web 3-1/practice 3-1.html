                <p class="lead">Teal is a blue-green colour. Its name comes from that of a bird—the common teal (Anas
                    crecca)—which presents a similarly colored stripe on its head. The word is often used colloquially
                    to refer to shades of cyan in general. It can be created by mixing blue into a green base, or
                    deepened as needed with black or gray.</p>
